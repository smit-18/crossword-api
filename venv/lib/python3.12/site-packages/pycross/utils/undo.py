class Operation:

    ## Constructor.
    # @param command `dict` the 'do' command (direct action) constisting
    # of a pointer to a function/method and arguments passed to it.
    # The dictionary keys are as follows:
    #   * func `callable` pointer to the 'do' function or other callable object
    #   * args `tuple` positional arguments passed to the 'do' function (optional)
    #   * kwargs `dict` keyword arguments passed to the 'do' function (optional)
    # @warning The first parameter passed to 'func' is always the pointer to this
    # Operation instance. So 'args' and/or 'kwargs' (if present) will start from
    # the second parameter.
    # @param undocommand `dict` the 'undo' command (reverse action undoing whatever
    # 'command' does). Its keys are the same as in 'command'.
    # @param description `str` optional description of the command (what is does).
    # The default is an empty string.
    # @param kwargs `keyword arguments` any extra objects that can be stored in
    # the Operation instance to address in the do / undo callbacks.
    # @warning Note that neither 'command' nor 'undocommand' provide means to
    # return a result -- their callback functions should therefore return nothing (`None`)
