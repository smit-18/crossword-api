* app extension through external and custom plugins (Python API included)
* comprehensive Doxygen-generated API reference and rich help documentation

## Installation

### Requirements
You must have the following applications / packages installed in your system:

* Python 3.7+ (the app was written and tested with Python 3.7.4 and 3.8.0)
* Python packages: 
	- pip
	- PyQt5>=5.14
	- QScintilla>=2.11
	- jedi>=0.16
	- yapsy>=1.12
	- requests
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- altair
* Git (should be pre-installed on most modern Linux and Mac systems, alternatively install from the [git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

The latter two (packages and Git) are not actually required if you opt for the PyPi (pip) installation variant as described below.

### Installation options
Choose one of the two installation options.

#### *1. Clone repo* - copy entire source code with version control history

  To get the latest (non-stable) version, run:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/S0mbre/crossword.git .
  ```

  This will checkout to the *master* branch which tracks all recent changes, some of which may not be yet merged into a release version.

  To get the latest stable version, run:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/S0mbre/crossword.git .
  git reset --hard latest
  ```

  This will checkout to the branch pointed at by the *latest* tag which will always be the latest stable release.

#### Install the required packages

  I recommend (as many do) installing packages into python's virtual environment using *virtualenv* or the inbuilt *venv*:

  Create a new virtual environment:

  **Linux / Mac**
  ```bash
  cd myprojects
  venv pycross
  cd pycross
  . ./bin/activate
  ```

  **Windows**
  ```bash
  cd myprojects
  venv pycross
  cd pycross
  scripts\activate.bat
  ```

  This step is, of course, optional. You can skip it if you don't want to use virtual environments for some reason or other. 

  Then just run:
  ```bash
  cd crossword
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  If you're using a virtual environment, you can deactivate it after closing the app with `deactivate`.

#### *2. Install from PyPi*

  Create your virtual environment as described above (which is again optional). Then use *pip* to download and install *pycrossword* (together with the required additional packages):
  ```
  pip install --upgrade pycrossword
  ```

## Usage
Run `pycross` on Linux/Mac or `pycross.bat` on Windows to launch the pycrossword UI app. This should work both with and without the Python virtual environment.

To launch the app manually, run 
```
python cwordg.py [optional command-line params]
```
from your pycross/ directory.

The command-line parameters that can be passed to cwordg.py are as follows:
* `-s` or `--settings` + `"path to *.pxjson settings file"`: load app from a preset (configuration file)
* `-o` or `--open` + `"path to crossword file"`: open a crossword file (\*.xpf or \*.ipuz)
* `-n` or `--new`: create a new crossword on startup (see creation parameters below)
* `--cols`: number of columns in the new crossword (default = 15)
* `--rows`: number of rows in the new crossword (default = 15)
* `--pattern`: pattern number for the new crossword (one of 1...6, default = 1)
* `-e` or `--empty`: don't open or create a crossword
* `-a` or `--addsrc` + `"{source data}"`: add a word source (see forms.py/WordSrcDialog for description of the source data structure)

Alternativaly, you can register the pycrossword file associations at initial run (go to *Settings* > *Common* > *Register file associations*). After that, you can launch the app by double-clicking crossword files (like \*.xpf or \*.ipuz) or settings files (\*.pxjson)

See User Guide for detailed usage.
